In the binary expansion of all real numbers between 0 and 1, all possible patterns exist.
Some patterns can be interpreted as computer programs.
Some programs are recursive functions, generating output patterns from the the previous invocation.
Some recursive programs are simulations, when the output is interpreted as a world state.
The world we live in is necessarily one of those simulations
We live in a natural simulation, not one designed but rather one inherent in the pure mathematics.
This blog explores some implications of this metaphysics.
